# WikiSearchApp

This application is powered by the MediaWiki API, React-Native, axios, expo-cli, ES7, and was created in Node.js.

I used the expo client on my android phone to test the application throughout the process.

To test on your phone, install the Expo project app from the app store.
---------
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
